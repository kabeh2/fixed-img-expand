# Javascript/jQuery Page Scroll Animation at Fixed Section of Page

This is a demo to show a sticky section of a page.

[X] While scrolling in view of 2nd section, it becomes fixed, user sees background change, and image scales up in size.

[X] When section is done scrolling, page will continue to scroll to next relative section.

[X] When scrolling back up, animation will reverse to initial settings.

Feel free to use this code for your own projects.

PS - This was a quick demo for client to show proof of concept. JS Code can definitely be refactored to be leaner.

Enjoy!
